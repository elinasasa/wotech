# Lesson 28, APIs

## Application programming interface
its like an access point. two programmes interacting with each other. back-end service to back-end service.


Backend in like a server. 

Protocols:
- NFC, = Bluetooth
- HTTP = hyper text transfer protocol. this is how web applications communicate with each other. 


Requests. way of communicating. 
Front end sending to back end = request. 

Back end answers = response. Sends back data to front end. 

when you get 404 Page not found error, that means backend didnt have a response. 

F12 button on computer on a website opens up some thingy - we are interested in Payload (or Body). It containsd ata that is needed for the question. 

Oskars as a parameter in the request. both request and response contain payload/body.

Opening developer tools.
